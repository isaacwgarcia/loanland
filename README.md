# LoanLand

## Problem:

At this time we can create money streams between employers - employees, lenders can lend money against this money stream, but so far there is no way to calculate a credit score for ongoing and completed transactions.

## Solution:

Create a lending platform that connects Lenders and Borrowers in the same space, leveraging their interactions and reputation in social media as a credit score.

## Technologies:

- Polygon
  Project fully deployed and implemented on Polygon Mumbai.

- IPFS Solution fully implemented way to store data from loans, profiles and images, to be used frequently by a large, growing and diverse audience.

- Lens Protocol to store data from social graphs.
  It lets lenders and borrowers take ownership of their content wherever they go in the digital garden of the decentralized internet.

- Superfluid to manage streams, loans and scoring smart contracts from borrowers and lenders.

- WorldCoin to verify actions from social app users.

Users are able to:

- Connect their wallet
- Create a Lens Protocol Profile
- Update lens profile's pice
- Lenders can create a Loan
- Borrowers can pre-apply for this loan
- Lenders can check the credit score of the borrowers before approving.
