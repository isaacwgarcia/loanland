# LoanLand

## Problem:

1.4 billion people in the world do not have a bank account. This makes it difficult for them to take advantage of financial products such as loans. Without having a KYC policy it is almost impossible to determine the financial risk of the client. Still in 2022 people remain unbanked for specific reasons, most common reasons are:  
Maintenance costs of bank accounts.  
Population living in rural areas.
Documentation requirements.
In short, no bank account, no KYC, no loans.

## Solution:

For years, the ideas about financial inclusion with blockchain was mostly theoretical. Nowadays, real-time payments are displacing cash and cards. With modern protocols we can offer a decentralized solution where companies and individuals can lend money and generate profits without using intermediaries and / or financial institutions. The main goal is to offer a platform and credit score system based on historical data of loans and use social profiles as a complement.

## Technologies:

- Polygon Project fully deployed and implemented on Polygon Mumbai.

- IPFS Solution fully implemented way to store data from loans, profiles and images, to be used frequently by a large, growing and diverse audience.

- Lens Protocol gives us a social environment, where we can create a marketplace to portray supply and demand of loans.

- Superfluid a streaming protocol to send money every second as a salary. Loans can be created in the middle of these salaries, and stream money to the employee and lenders.

- WorldCoin Proof of personhood, making sure that borrowers are real, and they are not impersonating someone else. No traditional KYC.

Features Implemented:

- Connect their wallet
- An individual / company can create a Profile on the Lens ecosystem.
- Lenders can post Loan Offers to all users of Lens Protocol.
- Borrower can apply for a loan.
- Lenders can approve and lend the money based on these applications.
- Credit score is based on basic metrics such as: Open Loans, Closed Loans, Unpaid Loans.

Future Plans

- Improve UI Experience
- Closing of flow upon loan payment completion
- Develop more complex credit scoring algorithms
- Notifications between borrowers and lenders.
